# Google Maps Class Demo

This is a basic demo of using the Google Maps JavaScript v3 API.

I have constructed a few simple examples to show how to get the API up and running.

## Getting Started

Before you begin you must obtain an API key from the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). You can make 25,000 requests per day **fo' free**.

To do this:
- create a new project
- go to 'APIs & auth' on the sidebar
- search for the relevant API (in this case we want 'Google Maps JavaScript API')
- go to 'Credentials' on the sidebar
- under 'Public API access' click 'Create new key'
- when prompted choose 'Browser key' (this is specific to this simple example, this may differ in your future projects)
- copy and paste the API key into your script tag for the API in the head of your HTML
